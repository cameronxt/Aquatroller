Aquatroller

By cameronxt

Description:

An arduino UNO based aquarium controller. Used to control various aspects of 
a freshwater planted tank. All the controllers i found used older hardware or 
were aimed at saltwater/reef tanks. I also wanted to use newer, more accurate 
peripherals than what i could find in most projects.

Working On:

* Temp Control Via heater
	- Set temperature
	- Control Heater Outlet based on temp
	- Monitor temp via DS ds18b20
		- Supports 2 Sensors as a fail safe
		
* CO2 Control
	- Monitor PH with a standard PH Probe
	- Actuate CO2 valve based on PH

* SD Card Logging
	- Log all events or just specific events
	- Store on SD card as a CSV for easy manipulation in spreadsheet
	
* EEPROM Settings
	-All settings stored in on-chip EEPROM
	
* Timer
	- Timing taken care of by DS3231 RTC
	- adjustable timing between checks (ie: Check PH every X seconds)
	- User settable light timer
	
* Lights
	- Control a minimum of six channels of LED's (Using Meanwell or similar drivers)
	- Independantly adjustable fade ramps
	- On/off timer
	
* Automatic Top-off
	- Uses 2 sensors as a failsafe
		- Rely's on optical sensor with a backup reed float
	- Open valve from (prefferably) an RO water system
	
	
	
Hardware:
I have designed a printable circuit board to allow easy plug and play of commonly available modules.
Arduino UNO(ATMega 328p): Main processor.
