Aquatroller - In Development

By cameronxt

Description:

An arduino UNO based aquarium controller. Used to control various aspects of 
  a freshwater planted tank. All the controllers i found used older hardware or 
  were aimed at saltwater/reef tanks. I also wanted to use newer, more accurate 
  peripherals than what i could find in most projects.

Working On:

* Temp Control Via heater
  - Set temperature
  - Control Heater Outlet based on temp
  - Monitor temp via DS ds18b20
  - Supports 2 Sensors as a fail safe
		
* CO2 Control
  - Monitor PH with a standard PH Probe
  - Actuate CO2 valve based on PH

* SD Card Logging
  - Log all events or just specific events
  - Store on SD card as a CSV for easy manipulation in spreadsheet
	
* EEPROM Settings
  -All settings stored in on-chip EEPROM
	
* Timer
  - Timing taken care of by DS3231 RTC
  - adjustable timing between checks (ie: Check PH every X seconds)
  - User settable light timer
	
* Lights
  - Control a minimum of six channels of LED's (Using Meanwell or similar drivers)
  - Independantly adjustable fade ramps
  - On/off timer
	
* Automatic Top-off
  - Uses 2 sensors as a failsafe
    - Relies on optical sensor with a backup reed float
      - Open valve from (prefferably) an RO water system
	
	
	
Hardware:
I have designed a printable circuit board to allow easy plug and play of commonly available modules.
  I will make this board and schematics available once I am done testing.

Arduino UNO(ATMega 328p): Main processor. I use an UNO Nano, because its small, but any UNO will 
  work fine if your breadboarding it.
  
RTC DS3231 - Much more accurate than the 1307 that everyone seems to use and about the same price as modules.
	
DS18b20 Temperture Sensor: x2 Sensors. I use the ones that are sealed in a stainless steel tube with 
  3 Meters of leads. These use a "one wire connection" and you can daisy chain as many as you would 
  like. Currently code only supports 2.
  
Photoelectric Liquid Level Sensor(SEN0205): Non-Mechanical Liquid level sensor. This is the main water 
  level Sensor. I cannot find a model number on my knockoff, but the part number on dfRobots's website
  is SEN0205 to give you an example.

Reed Float Switch - Mechanical Fluid level detector. I mounted this slightly above the optical sensor. 
  This will be a backup sensor.
  
Bluetooth Module - Currently using an HC-05 as that what i have on hand, But will add support for HM-10.
  
SD Card Reader - 

4 Channel Solid State Relay - Highly reccomend a solid state instead of electro-magnetic

Meanwell LDD Series Drivers - Should work with any driver that accepts 5V PWM for dimming

PCA9685 PWM Servo Module - Give us 16 channels of 12-bit (4096 steps VS Arduino's 255). Runs on I2C

SD Card Reader Module - I used a generic SPI module, most should work

PH Sener Module with PH Probe - I used a generic module
